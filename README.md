# ~/git/bullshit

Welcome to the digital landfill.

This is where abandoned side projects, cursed experiments, and "what-if" ideas come to scream into the void. Nothing in here is production-ready, emotionally stable, or legally sound.

## ❓ Why

Because not everything needs to be useful, and not everything useful needs to be finished.

Also because git doesn't judge me. Yet.

## ☠️ Warnings

- Side effects may include: existential dread, spontaneous refactoring, and loud sighs.
- Nothing is documented. Everything is deprecated. Good luck.
- If it works, it’s a miracle. If it doesn’t, that’s on-brand.

## 🧼 License

Unlicensed chaos. Do what you want. Just don’t blame me.
